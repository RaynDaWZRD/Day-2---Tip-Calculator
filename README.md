# Day-2---Tip-Calculator
Day 2 was exciting as I built out the tip calculator and shared it with friends and family. This became my first project I have used multiple times via replit.
Along with some basic math operations, I decided to take it a step further by learning my first while loop and how to import modules.
The while loop functions as a way to make sure the person using the calculator does not cause a div/0 error when inputting the number of people splitting the bill.
Our imports of locale and re also played a huge part. locale was used to make sure we followed the currency format of our location. In this case, the United States. The re module or regular expression module allows us to recgonize patterns such as currency signs and remove them in order to only take the numerical value of our total bill.
